\section{Reproducibility}
\label{sec:repro}
All figures and tables in this paper are generated by deterministic scripts in the accompanying repo. The main entrypoints are (i) a physics check that rebuilds Lean and regenerates all physics artifacts and (ii) a paper build script that compiles this \LaTeX{} source using exported figures/tables. The block below is auto-generated from the repo state and lists the required artifacts and the script that produces each one.

In addition to regenerating artifacts, the physics suite is written as a set of \emph{contract checks}: each instantiation includes explicit null gates that must pass (e.g.\ $\sigma=0$ implies zero LES commutator, $s=0$ implies zero averaging mismatch, $\lambda=1$ implies exact dephasing idempotence, and the quantum DPI run reports zero violations beyond tolerance). These checks are best read as regression certificates for the implemented audits and operators rather than as new empirical evidence for known theorems.
